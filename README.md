# Demlo - a dynamic and extensible music library organizer

Demlo is a music library organizer. It can encode, fix case, change folder
hierarchy according to tags or file properties, tag from an online database,
copy covers while ignoring duplicates or those below a quality threshold, and
much more. It makes it possible to manage your libraries uniformly and
dynamically. You can write your own rules to fit your needs best.

Demlo aims to be as lightweight and portable as possible. Its only big
dependency is the transcoder FFmpeg. The scripts are written in Lua for
portability and speed while allowing virtually unlimited extensibility.

## Installation

* Go
* Lua (â‰¥5.1)
