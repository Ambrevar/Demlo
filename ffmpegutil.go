/* ffmpegSplitTimes returns the starting time and duration (in FFmpeg CLI format) of a track in a multi-track file.

Since a cuesheet does not contain the total duration, we cannot infere last
track's duration only from the sheet. We need to pass it as parameter.

Total duration is a floating value; second is the unit.

First track is track 0.

TODO: We ignore Indices beyond the first one. As a result, it may include
silences. But always skipping the first index (if there is a second one) might
not be he desired result either. Finally, there could be more than 2 indices,
even thought I have no clue to what use. Rationale needed.
